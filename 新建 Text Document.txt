The choice between "a" and "an" depends on the sound of the word that follows. 

If the word that follows begins with a consonant sound, use "a". For example:

* a cat
* a dog
* a house
* a boy

On the other hand, if the word that follows begins with a vowel sound, use "an". For example:

* an apple
* an elephant
* an hour
* an orange

Note that it's the sound of the word that matters, not the actual spelling. For instance:

* a European (because "European" starts with a "y" sound, which is a consonant sound)
* an FBI agent (because "FBI" is pronounced "ef-bee-eye", which starts with a vowel sound)

Also, be aware of silent letters. For example:

* an honest man (because the "h" is silent, and the word starts with a vowel sound)
* a historic event (because the "h" is not silent, and the word starts with a consonant sound)

In general, if you're unsure which one to use, try saying the sentence out loud. If it sounds more natural with "a", use "a". If it sounds more natural with "an", use "an".
